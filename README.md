# Pokedex App
## Running it
To run this app, first unzip the multiple zip files in the resources folder by selecting 
all the .z01, .z02,..., z10 and .zip files. A .db file should appear in the directory called
pokedex.db

Once this file is uncompressed, run the following to create and use a virtual environment and install
the requirements:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that, run the app by doing:

```
python main.py
